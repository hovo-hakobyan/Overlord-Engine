This project was made for Graphics Programming 2 in DAE. Stepping away from the traditional engines, Overlord Engine showed me the challenges that you are faced with when working with a fully custum engine, from which I grew a lot. A couple of mentions:

* Learnt the basics of HSLS, wrote a grass and lava shader
* Implemented level loading from an image file.
* Implemented a level based UI, instead of the traditional UI
* Learnt a lot about optimization in general
